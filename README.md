# Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) on Azure Data Engineering Stack

## üìå Overview

This project implements a data engineering solution for **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** in the **Healthcare domain**, leveraging the **Azure Data Engineering stack**. 

RCM refers to the financial process healthcare facilities use to manage administrative and clinical functions associated with claims processing, payment, and revenue generation‚Äîfrom patient scheduling to final payment.

## üè• RCM Workflow - Simplified

### 1. Patient Visit and Data Collection
- Patient schedules an appointment.
- Demographic and **insurance details** are collected.
- Determines payment source: **Insurance**, **Patient**, or **both**.

> Example:
> - Total Bill: $20,000  
> - Insurance Pays: $15,000  
> - Patient Pays: $5,000

---

### 2. Service Delivery
- Healthcare services are provided to the patient.

---

### 3. Billing
- The hospital generates a bill for the services rendered.

---

### 4. Claims Review
- Claims are submitted to the **insurance company**.
- Insurer may:
  - Approve full payment.
  - Approve partial payment.
  - Reject the claim.

---

### 5. Payments & Follow-ups
- If partially paid or rejected:
  - Patient is billed for the remaining amount.
  - Hospital follows up to recover the payment.

---

### 6. Tracking & Continuous Improvement
- RCM systems provide visibility and analytics to:
  - Improve billing accuracy.
  - Reduce denials.
  - Ensure financial sustainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Azure Data Engineering Stack

This solution uses the following Azure components:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For data ingestion pipelines.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: Centralized storage for raw and curated data.
- **Azure Databricks / Synapse Analytics**: Data transformation, analytics, and modeling.
- **Azure SQL Database / Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool**: For storing cleansed and modeled data.
- **Azure Functions / Logic Apps**: For automation and alerting.
- **Power BI**: For visualization and reporting (RCM KPIs, denial trends, payment status, etc.)

---

## üìä Example Use Cases

- Identify **claim denial reasons** by payer and service type.
- Analyze **payment timelines** across insurance providers.
- Track **patient responsibility vs insurance share**.
- Monitor **revenue leakage** points in the process.

---

## üöÄ Benefits

- Automates and streamlines the RCM lifecycle.
- Improves **cash flow** and **claim acceptance rates**.
- Reduces **manual follow-ups** and **administrative overhead**.
- Enhances **financial transparency** for providers.
